# BubbysBurgers
 Project for CS-305 @ Marshall University.
 This is a basic Restaurant Reservation System which contains a website that makes use of databases for logins (Owner/Manager), a menu, and reservations at all locations.

# Before you run...
 To run this project, you should have Node.js installed. You can install this [here](www.nodejs.org). Be sure to install to the PATH variable.
 Additionally, be sure you have downloaded `config.json` found in the shared group files on Blackboard and put it into the project. This file contains authentication information for automated emails and databases.
 In a command prompt, navigate to the directory. When running it for the first time, run `npm install`. This will download all project dependencies.
 To now run the project, use command `node index.js`.

# config.json
 Be sure that when you run the project, `config.json` found in our shared group files on Blackboard is located in the project. (As of now, this is not needed. This will be important when we start using databases and automated emails)
